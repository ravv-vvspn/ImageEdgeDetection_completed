REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 bramdut/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin bramdut/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: bramdut/Q[8]) which is driven by a register (controller/addr_counter_reg[8]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
