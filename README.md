1. "AssigmentReport" pdf file gives an overview of the project and implementation details of the project
2. "Gateware Engineer Assignment.pdf" is problem statement and specifications to be met
3. "Improvements Needed" file lists some issues faced and possible improvements during intial submission on March 23
4. "Improvements Made" file lists the final improvements that were made to finalize the design on March 25 Midnight IST/ March 26 Early morning


Subfolder contents discussed below


1. "16_images_tested" folder contains 16 different input images, and their corresponding outputs. Since the input images are 64x64, only images with clear edges standing out give clear outputs at 31x31 pixel dimensions. So some outputs appear a little messy, while others appear very clear.
2. "Sim_waveforms" folder contains pictures of simulation waveforms after simulations were run at Behavioral, Post-Synthesis and Post-Implementation functional sim runs. It also contains waveform DB files that can be loaded into Xilinx Vivado.
3. "Verilog_constraints" folder contains constraints file, the testbench verilog file and all Device under Test Top module and submodule files
4. "Python2_scripts" folder contains script used to generate input image data in row major order to be stored into BRAM. It also contains script used to convert output pixel data in a text file into Output image.
5. "reports" folder contains all the reports that were generated by Xilinx Vivado tool report menus.
